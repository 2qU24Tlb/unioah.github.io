Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine. Java libraries may be used directly in Scala code and vice versa (language interoperability). Like Java, Scala is object-oriented. Unlike Java, Scala has many features of functional programming languages like Scheme, Standard ML and Haskell, including currying, type inference, immutability, lazy evaluation, and pattern matching. It also has an advanced type system supporting algebraic data types, covariance and contravariance, higher-order types, and anonymous types. Other features of Scala not present in Java include operator overloading, optional parameters, named parameters, raw strings, and no checked exceptions. [wiki]

In general, scala code should be compiled to java bytecode before execution. 
## Compile:
    scalac    compile
    scala     run
    compile options:
	  -d            use different output directory.
      -classpath    use different classpath.

It would be convenient to use [scala-maven-plugin] plugin to compile & run scala program automatically. 
Put the [maven-template] (rename to pom.xml) in the source code. 
     
     compile: mvn compile
     run: mvn scala:run -DmainClass=org.example.MyClass
**file name should follow the name of main class.**

Thanks to the scala shell, we can use alternatives ways to run scala code.
## Run a spark shell:
  Bash:  scala

## Run as bash script:
```bash
#!/bin/sh
exec scala "$0" "$@"
!#
object HelloWorld {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      println("Hello, world! " + args.toList)
   }
}
  HelloWorld.main(args)
```

## Coding Style:
- class name: initial letter should be in upper case.
- method: start with lowercase and after initial letter should be in uppercase.
- program file name: match the object name
