Solved the "can't find method" problem. It is related to HashMap library in scala. In maven, scala-core-2.11 is not compatible with spark. "Spark runs on Java 6+ and Python 2.6+. For the Scala API, Spark 1.3.1 uses Scala 2.10. You will need to use a compatible Scala version (2.10.x)."[https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/]

[ToDo]
